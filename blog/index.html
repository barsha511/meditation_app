          <h3>Programmers who meditate, assemble!</h3>
          <p class="publish-date">by Reddit User on July 21, 2021</p>

On the other hand, for a non believer, it is simply a set of breathing exercises. If you are a programmer and aspire to benefit from the power of meditation, you need to hit the middle ground between these two extremes. !</p>
